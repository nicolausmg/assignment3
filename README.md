# Assignment 3: Docker and Git

In this assignment, we collaborated on software development and containerization using Git and Docker. The work was divided into four parts.

## Part 1: Git Collaboration

We created a shared Git repository, with each member cloning it, making commits, and using a branching workflow. Collaboration was demonstrated through pull requests and merges. Deliverables included the repository URL, screenshots of commits, and a merged pull request.

## Part 2: Docker Compose 

We set up a web app and database using Docker Compose, configured with a custom Docker bridge network and static IPs for container communication. Deliverables included the docker-compose.yml file, network setup documentation, and a network inspection screenshot.

## Part 3: Environment Variables 

We managed configurations with a .env file and created a multi-stage Dockerfile optimized for development and production. We also documented best practices for securing sensitive information. Deliverables included the .env file, Dockerfile, and security documentation.

## Part 4: Deployment

We deployed the application with Docker Compose, resolved issues, and documented troubleshooting steps. A group report summarized contributions, challenges, and lessons learned. Deliverables included troubleshooting notes, the report, and a screenshot of running containers.
