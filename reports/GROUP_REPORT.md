## Reflection 

As a group, we have managed to work very well. As with our previous experience in Assignment 2, we were all dedicated to getting the project completed. We met several times and kept in touch to enhance communication and make everything easier. We didn't experience any group dymanics problems. 


One of the hardest parts was using new tools like Flask and becoming more familiar with Docker. It was tricky at first, but we figured it out through research and trial-and-error. For example, connecting the SSH key to Docker and setting up networks took extra effort.

## Learinigns and challenges. 

### 1. Learning the Flask Framework

None of the team members had prior experience with Flask, which made it challenging to start the project. We needed to research the framework and understand its basics to get our application running. We divided the work to explore Flask tutorials and documentation (see further explanation on CODE_EXPLANATION.txt). We shared findings in group meetings, which helped us gain a solid understanding and progress efficiently.

### 2. Connecting the SSH Key with Docker

We also leant how to conect the Dockerfile with the code stored in GitHub and not that of the local repository. 

### 3. .gitignore

It was the first time we were actually using the gitignore file (we saw it in class but never used it). We learnt how to implement it properly,

### 4. Docker

It has been very useful to better undrestand the main components of Docker, mainly the Dockerfile and docker-compose files. We had been practiving it in the labs, but most of the time with very specific guidelines, never so free. We learnt a lot.
